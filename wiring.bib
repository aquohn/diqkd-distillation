  title = {Device-independent quantum key distribution secure against collective attacks},
  journal = {New Journal of Physics},
  abstract = {Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) represents a relaxation of the security assumptions made in usual quantum key distribution (QKD). As in usual QKD, the security of DIQKD follows from the laws of quantum physics, but contrary to usual QKD, it does not rely on any assumptions about the internal working of the quantum devices used in the protocol. In this paper, we present in detail the security proof for a DIQKD protocol introduced in Acín et al (2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 230501). This proof exploits the full structure of quantum theory (as opposed to other proofs that exploit only the no-signaling principle), but only holds against collective attacks, where the eavesdropper is assumed to act on the quantum systems of the honest parties independently and identically in each round of the protocol (although she can act coherently on her systems at any time). The security of any DIQKD protocol necessarily relies on the violation of a Bell inequality. We discuss the issue of loopholes in Bell experiments in this context.}

We initiate the study of this scenario as a unification of two standard scenarios: (i) key distillation (agreement) from classical correlations and (ii) key distillation from pure tripartite quantum states.",

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce intrinsic non-locality and quantum intrinsic non-locality as quantifiers for Bell non-locality, and we prove that they satisfy certain desirable properties such as faithfulness, convexity, and monotonicity under local operations and shared randomness. We then prove that intrinsic non-locality is an upper bound on the secret-key-agreement capacity of any device-independent protocol conducted using a device characterized by a correlation p, while quantum intrinsic non-locality is an upper bound on the same capacity for a correlation arising from an underlying quantum model. We also prove that intrinsic steerability is faithful, and it is an upper bound on the secret-key-agreement capacity of any one-sided-device-independent protocol conducted using a device characterized by an assemblage . Finally, we prove that quantum intrinsic non-locality is bounded from above by intrinsic steerability.}
