  \section{Introduction}

  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is a remarkable form of quantum key distribution (QKD) that relies on fundamental properties of causality in order to certify the security of a generated secret key, removing the need to characterise the physical devices involved in generating them. These devices are then seen as black boxes with classical inputs and outputs, whose statistical correlations can certify the non-classical nature of their internal processes, and therefore the privacy of the generated data. This certification is done using \emph{Bell tests}, which detects the non-classical phenomenon of \emph{nonlocality}. Formally, in each round, the two players Alice and Bob can provide inputs \(x\) and \(y\), respectively, to their devices, and obtain outputs \(a\) and \(b\), respectively. The joint conditional distribution that is observed over asymptotically many rounds is called the \emph{behaviour} \(p(ab|xy)\). The behaviour alone (with a few weak assumptions) is sufficient for Alice and Bob to generate secret keys.

  Despite this extraordinary guarantee of security, progress in understanding and implementing DIQKD has been slow. For example, given a particular behaviour, we do not have a tight expression for the amount of secrecy that can be extracted per use of the devices. This project aims to explore this aspect of DIQKD from two directions. Firstly, we aim to find an upper bound for the DIQKD key rate from a given behaviour, where each round undergoes independent classical post-processing. Secondly, we wish to see if classical post-processing that \emph{combines} multiple rounds to produce a new behaviour can lead to improvements over these upper bounds. This post-processing is referred to as \emph{wiring}, and can be seen as the act of connecting the inputs and outputs of multiple devices together, with arbitrary logic gates between them.

  Our ideal outcome from this project is to find an efficient algorithm that, given a behaviour, can specify the wiring that produces the behaviour with the largest possible keyrate. A trivial, inefficient algorithm would be to simply compute all possible wirings by brute force, although this will necessarily restrict our search to a limited subset of the possible wirings, since we can wire together arbitrarily many boxes. If no such algorithm exists, we would want to understand why. Is it that wiring multiple boxes together cannot give an advantage over post-processing a single box? Is the structure of achievable boxes simply too complex to navigate efficiently?

  While this task is daunting, we hope that, even if we fall far short of this ideal outcome, this project can contribute to a better understanding of the mysterious phenomenon of nonlocality, and to the work of harnessing it for human benefit.

  \section{Preliminaries}

  In order to be compatible with the theory of relativity, the behaviour of a device must fulfil the \emph{no-signalling condition}, which states that the marginal probabilities for each player's output cannot depend on the other player's input:
  \begin{gather}
    \sum_b p(ab|xy) = p(a|xy) = p(a|x)\;\forall a,x,y \\
    \sum_a p(ab|xy) = p(b|xy) = p(b|y)\;\forall b,x,y.
  \end{gather}

  Many important statistics can be expressed in terms of the \emph{correlators} \(\angleb{A_x B_y}\) and the \emph{marginals} \(\angleb{A_x}\) and \(\angleb{B_y}\):
  \begin{gather}
    \angleb{A_x B_y} \coloneqq p(a=b|xy) - p(a\neq b|xy) \\
    \angleb{A_x} \coloneqq \sum_a \lambda_a p(a|x) \qquad \angleb{B_y} \coloneqq \sum_b \lambda_b p(b|y),
  \end{gather}
  where \(\lambda_a\) and \(\lambda_b\) are values that are associated to those outputs when defining the setting.

  In the simplest nontrivial setting, where \(a,b,x,y \in \{0,1\}\), we have the quantum bit error rate (QBER) \(Q_{xy}\) and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) value \(S\):
  \begin{gather}
    Q_{xy} \coloneqq p(a \neq b|xy) = \frac{1-\angleb{A_x B_y}}{2} \\
    S \coloneqq \angleb{A_0 B_0} + \angleb{A_1 B_0} + \angleb{A_0 B_1} - \angleb{A_1 B_1}.
  \end{gather}
  Behaviours with \(S > 2\) are necessarily non-classical, while the behaviours allowed by quantum physics are constrained to have \(S \leq 2\sqrt{2}\).

  Perhaps the best-known DIQKD protocol is given in~\cite{DIQKD_Lower}, which also gives a formula to explicitly calculate the keyrate \(r\) in terms of \(Q\) and \(S\). This protocol introduces an additional possible setting \(y = 2\), and uses Alice's and Bob's received outputs in the rounds with \(x = 0, y = 2\) as the key. Therefore, we have \(Q = Q_{02}\) and
  \begin{equation}
    r \geq 1 - h_2(Q) - h_2\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{{(S/2)}^2-1}}{2} \right),
  \end{equation}
  where \(h_2(x) = - x \log x - (1-x) \log (1-x)\) is the binary entropy function, with the logarithm in base 2. Being the rate for an explicit, achievable protocol, this rate is a lower bound for the total secrecy extractable. It is tight amongst bounds that depend only on \(Q\) and \(S\).
   % TODO proof of this

  The derivative of \(h_2(x)\) is
  \[ \diffp{{h_2(x)}}{x} = \frac{1}{\ln 2} \ln \left(\frac{1-x}{x}\right), \]
  from which it can be seen that for \(Q \in [0, 0.5]\), the keyrate increases for decreasing \(Q\). It is always possible to achieve this value of \(Q\) by flipping all bits if the raw value for \(Q\) is \(> 0.5\).

  Simple differentiation also shows that \(r\) increases with increasing \(S\):
  \begin{align*}
    \ln (2) \diffp{r}{S} &= - \left( \diffp{}{S} \frac{1 + \sqrt{(S/2)^2-1}}{2} \right) \ln \left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{(S/2)^2-1}}{2} / \frac{1 + \sqrt{(S/2)^2-1}}{2} \right) \\
                 &= - \left( \frac{1}{4} \left( (S/2)^2-1 \right)^{-1/2} \diffp{}{S} \left[ (S/2)^2-1 \right] \right) \ln \left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{(S/2)^2-1}}{1 + \sqrt{(S/2)^2-1}} \right) \\
                 &= \underbrace{\left( \frac{S}{ 8\sqrt{(S/2)^2-1} } \right)}_{\geq 0} \ln \underbrace{ \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{(S/2)^2-1}}{1 - \sqrt{(S/2)^2-1}} \right) }_{\geq 1} \because \sqrt{{(S/2)}^2-1} \geq 0 \\
                 &\geq 0.
  \end{align*}

  \subsection{Upper Bounds}

  There are a number of upper bounds for key rates in the literature, computed using a large variety of techniques. These bounds can be for the keyrate achievable from a specific state, or from a specific behaivour. An important property of an upper bound is whether it is \emph{faithful}: faithful upper bounds are those that have non-zero keyrates for all entangled states or all nonlocal behaviours. For our purposes, a non-faithful upper bound is much more helpful---if local wirings between multiple copies of the same device are able to \emph{revive} the keyrate, that would be very interesting from both theoretical and practical standpoints. Theoretically, it would develop our currently limited understanding of the nature of the \emph{secrecy capacity} of no-signalling behaviours, and practically, it would be an easily-implemented technique that can squeeze secrecy out of a poorly-functioning system.

  A notable non-faithful upper bound is given in~\cite{NotSufficient}, where Eve, who controls the source that provides quantum states for the devices to measure, can sometimes choose to distribute \emph{local correlations}, which she has full information on, while distributing nonlocal correlations at all other times. This \emph{convex combination} attack, so called because the resultant behaviour is a convex combination of the local and nonlocal behaviours, can simulate the correlations that are generated by inefficient projective measurements on Werner states. These behaviours are nonlocal, that is, they have \(S > 2\), but the fact that they were generated in this manner can be used to prove that standard protocols, where both Alice and Bob announce their measurement settings, cannot generate secret keys from them.

  TODO:\ More information on other upper bounds to come.

  \subsection{AND Gates}

    Consider the following simple wiring, where we broadcast the same inputs \(x\) and \(y\) to \(N\) boxes on each side, and drive an AND gate with all the outputs.

    For \(N\) boxes,
    \begin{gather}
      \angleb{A_x B_y}_{N} = 1 - \frac{{(1-\angleb{B_y})}^N + {(1-\angleb{A_x})}^N}{2^{N-1}} + \frac{1}{4^{N-1}} {(1-\angleb{A_x} - \angleb{B_y} + \angleb{A_x B_y})}^{N} \\
      \angleb{A_x}_{N} = 1 - 2 {\left(\frac{1-\angleb{A_x}}{2}\right)}^N \qquad \angleb{B_y}_{N} = 1 - 2 {\left(\frac{1-\angleb{B_y}}{2}\right)}^N.
    \end{gather}

    \section{Local Wirings}

    \subsection{Classifying Wirings}

    The possible wirings between boxes are sometimes claimed to be classified by the scheme of Short et al.~\cite{ShortEntangleSwap}, for example in~\cite{ShortClassClaim}. This work attempts to generalise joint measurements to the no-signalling setting and finds a polytope of possible operations which happens to have local wirings at its extremal points. For the case of two binary-input, binary-output boxes, there are 82 extremal points, grouped into 5 possible types of wirings: deterministic output, where the input is precisely the output; one-sided, where only one box is used; sequential, where the output of the first box is used as input for the second box, and AND and XOR gated, where the respective gates are used to combine the output of the two boxes.

    However, this does not mean that this polytope exhausts the possible space of local wirings. This section will be devoted to presenting an alternative framework for enumerating the possible wirings, in order to enable an exhaustive search.

    Let each player have \(c\) boxes, and let subscripts denote the order in which the boxes are used. Then, Alice's wiring can be represented by a sequence of \(c\) functions with range \(\{1..i_A\}\)
    \begin{equation} x_1 = x \end{equation}
    \begin{equation} x_j = C_j^A(x_1, \ldots, x_{j-1}, a_1, \ldots, a_{j-1}),\,j \in \{2..c\} \end{equation}
    and a final output function with range \(\{1..o_A\}\)
    \begin{equation} a = C^A(x_1, \ldots, x_{c}, a_1, \ldots, a_{c}). \end{equation}
    Alice and Bob interact with their boxes in increasing order of the index \(j\). The condition that the input to box \(j\) can only depend on the inputs and outputs of boxes with index \(< j\) is equivalent to enforcing that Alice and Bob do not have quantum memories: both players must provide an input to a given box before it can produce an output.

    A wiring corresponding to the lookup tables in~\Cref{tab:wiring_lut} would have
    \begin{equation}
      x_2 = \bar{a}_1x_1 \qquad a = x_1x_2\bar{a}_1\bar{a}_2 + \bar{x}_1\bar{x}_2a_1a_2,
    \end{equation}
    where juxtaposition is the Boolean AND, addition is the Boolean OR, and the overbar is the Boolean NOT.\ This cannot be expressed as one of the wirings from~\cite{ShortEntangleSwap}: the boxes are clearly non-constant and dependent on each other, so they are not one-sided or deterministic, and the functional 

    \subsection{Number of Distinct Wirings}

    Simple combinatorics gives us \(i_A^{j-1} o_A^{j-1}\) possible inputs for \(C_j^A\). However, since \(x_j\) is completely fixed by \({(x_k)}_{k=1}^{j-1}\) and \({(a_k)}_{k=1}^{j-1}\), there are only \(i_A o_A^{j-1}\) valid inputs, with the rest corresponding to don't-cares. Therefore, the number of possible \(C_j^A\) is \(\exp_{i_A}(i_A o_A^{j-1})\). Similarly, the number of possible \(C^A\) is \(\exp_{o_A}(i_A o_A^{c})\). The total number of wirings is then
    \begin{equation}
      \exp_{o_A}(i_A o_A^c) \prod_{j=2}^c \exp_{i_A}(i_A o_A^{j-1}),
    \end{equation}
    where we count from \(j = 2\) because for \(j = 1\), there is only one possibility. The same applies to Bob with the appropriate changes of labels \(A \mapsto B\), \(x \mapsto y\), \(a \mapsto b\). 

    We may wish to fix some input settings to use a given wiring. For example, it is clear that the AND gating can only increase the value of the correlator. Therefore, we can fix the key generating settings \(A_1\) and \(B_3\) to be AND-wired, so that all functions with \(x_1 = 1\) or \(y_1 = 3\) are fixed to the AND wiring. If we fix the wirings for \(f\) input settings, then we are free to choose the outputs for only \(i_A - f\) possible values of \(x_1\), so the number of possible wirings becomes
    \begin{equation}
      \exp_{o_A}((i_A-f) o_A^c) \prod_{j=2}^c \exp_{i_A}((i_A-f) o_A^{j-1})
    \end{equation}
    for Alice, with the analogous relabelling for Bob.

    \subsection{Evaluation}

    Unfortunately, with just two boxes, there are 4096 wirings for Alice, and \(\approx \num{2.48e10}\) for Bob. Fixing the AND gating as discussed above gives us 1024 wirings for Alice and \(\approx \num{3.10e9}\) for Bob. Since the choice of wirings for Alice and Bob are independent, we must multiply the figures for Alice and Bob together, which would make this analysis very inefficient.

    This enumeration of the possible wirings is naive, and does not attempt to use symmetry arguments to remove degeneracy. This is one possible direction for us to investigate, in order to develop a tool to efficiently find the optimal wiring for a given behaviour. However, obtaining a deeper understanding of the problem through these methods seems unlikely. Given a family of behaviours and a figure of merit (either an upper bound or lower bound), it is possible to exhaustively search for the wiring for each particular behaviour that produces the largest increase in the figure of merit. However, since there is no convenient parametrisation or classification of the wirings, it would be difficult to generalise this data or draw any conclusions from it. Attempting to develop such a classification scheme for wirings in order to enable this analysis is another possible direction for this project, which would subsume the symmetry analysis discussed above.

    \section{Quantum Model}

    Our preliminary results found a revival of the Pironio key rate for states that are generated according to a simple experimental model. In this model, we denote the behaviour given by the states and measurements, assuming a perfect experimental setup, by \(\tilde{p}\), while the observed probability distribution is denoted by \(p\). The probability of no signal being produced is \(n_c\), and the efficiencies of Alice and Bob's detectors are \(\eta_A\) and \(\eta_B\) respectively. When nothing is detected, either due to no signal being produced or due to detector inefficiency, we assign the \(-1\) outcome. Therefore, the observed probabilities are
    \begin{align*}
      p(a|x) &= \delta_{a,-1}(n_c + 1 - \eta_A) + (\eta_A - n_c)\tilde{p}(a|x) \\
      p(b|y) &= \delta_{b,-1}(n_c + 1 - \eta_B) + (\eta_B - n_c)\tilde{p}(b|y) \\
      p(ab|xy) &= \begin{aligned}[c] \delta_{a,-1}\delta_{b,-1}n_c + (1-n_c) [ \delta_{a,-1} \delta_{b,-1}(1-\eta_A\eta_B) + \eta_A\eta_B \tilde{p}(ab|xy) \\
        + \delta_{b,-1}\eta_A(1-\eta_B)\tilde{p}(a|x) + \delta_{a,-1}\eta_B(1-\eta_A)\tilde{p}(b|y) ] 
      \end{aligned}
    \end{align*}

    For our purposes, we fix \(\eta_A = \eta_B = \eta\). Then, we have
    \begin{align*}
      \diffp{}{{n_c}} \angleb{A_x B_y} &= \eta \left( \left(1-\eta\right) \left(\langle\tilde{A}_x\rangle + \langle\tilde{B}_y\rangle\right) - \eta \langle\tilde{A}_x\tilde{B}_y\rangle + \left(2 - \eta\right) \right) \\
      \diffp{}{{\eta}} \angleb{A_x B_y} &= \left(1 - n_{c}\right) \left( \left(1-2\eta\right) \left(\langle\tilde{A}_x\rangle+\langle\tilde{B}_y\rangle\right) - 2\eta \langle\tilde{A}_x\tilde{B}_y\rangle + (2-2\eta) \right) \\
      \diffp{}{S} H^S(A|E) &= \frac{S}{4\sqrt{S^2-4}} \log_2 \left[ \frac{\sqrt{S^2-4}-2}{\sqrt{S^2-4}+2} \right]
    \end{align*}

    \section{Asymmetric CHSH}

    Better key rates have been obtained from asymmetric versions of the CHSH inequality:
    \begin{equation}
      S_{\alpha} \coloneqq \alpha\angleb{A_0 B_0} + \alpha\angleb{A_1 B_0} + \angleb{A_0 B_1} - \angleb{A_1 B_1}.
    \end{equation}
    This technique can then be combined with noisy preprocessing, where Alice replaces each bit of her key with a locally random bit with probability \(q\). The lower bound for \(H(A_0|E)\), with \(s = S_{\alpha}\) from the test statistics, is
    \[ H(A_0|E) \geq g_{q,\alpha}(s) = \begin{cases}
      g(s) & \text{ for } \abs{\alpha} \geq 1 \text{ or } s \geq s^* \\
      h(q) + g'(s^*)(\abs{s}-2) & \text{ otherwise},
    \end{cases}
    \]
    where
    \begin{equation}
      g_{q,\alpha}(s) = 1 + \phi\left(R_1\right) - \phi\left(R_2\right),
    \end{equation}
    with
    \begin{equation} 
      R_1 = \sqrt{{(1-2q)}^2 + 4q(1-q)(s^2/4-\alpha^2)} \qquad R_2 = \sqrt{s^2/4-\alpha^2}
    \end{equation}
    and where \(s^*\) is the solution to
    \begin{equation}\label{eqn:sstar}
      h(q) + g'(s^*) (s^*-2) = g(s^*).
    \end{equation}

    For a function \(R(s)\) of \(s\), it can easily be verified that
    \begin{equation}
      \diff{\phi(R)}{s} = \frac{1}{2} \diff{R}{s} \log\frac{1-R}{1+R},
    \end{equation}
    and since
    \begin{equation} 
      R_1'(s) = \frac{qs(1-q)}{R_1} \qquad R_2'(s) = \frac{s}{4R_2},
    \end{equation}
    we have
    \begin{equation}
      g_{q,\alpha}'(s) = \frac{qs(1-q)}{2R_1} \log\frac{1-R_1}{1+R_1} - \frac{s}{4R_2} \log\frac{1-R_2}{1+R_2}.
    \end{equation}

    \section{Nonlocality Monotones}

    The maximal correlation between two rvs \(A,B\) is denoted as \(\rho(A,B)\) and defined as
    \begin{equation}
      \rho(A,B) = \max_{f,g} \frac{\E[(f(A)-\E[f(A)])(g(B)-\E[g(B)])]}{\sqrt{\Var[f(A)]\Var[g(B)]}}
    \end{equation}
    or equivalently
    \begin{Array}{rcl}
      \rho(A,B) = & \max_{f,g}  & \E[f(A)g(B)] \\
                  & \text{s.t.} & \E[f(A)] = \E[g(B)] = 0 \\
                  &             & \E[f(A)^2] = \E[g(B)^2] = 1.
    \end{Array}

    For the maximal correlation \(\rho(A,B|X=x,Y=y)\), where we simply use the conditional distributions in place of the unconditioned distributions, we define the matrices
    \begin{align}
      \matrp{P}{_{AB|xy}}_{ab} &= \Pr(A = a, B = b|X = x, Y = y) \\
      \matrp{P}{_{A|x}}_{ab} &= \delta_{ab} \Pr(A = a|X = x) \\
      \matrp{P}{_{B|y}}_{ab} &= \delta_{ab} \Pr(B = b|Y = y) \\
      \matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}} &= \matrp{P}{_{A|x}}^{-1/2} \matrp{P}{_{AB|xy}} \matrp{P}{_{B|y}}^{-1/2} \\
      \therefore \matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}}_{ab} &= \frac{p(a,b|x,y)}{\sqrt{p(a|x)p(b|y)}},
    \end{align}
    where \(\matrp{P}{_{A|x}}_{ab}\), \(\matrp{P}{_{B|y}}_{ab}\), \(\matrp{P}{_{AB|xy}}_{ab}\) and \(\matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}}\) have dimensions \(o_A \times o_A\), \(o_B \times o_B\), \(o_A \times o_B\), \(o_A \times o_B\) respectively. We use the Moore-Penrose inverse for this inversion, which, since \(\matrp{P}{_{A|x}}_{ab}\) and \(\matrp{P}{_{B|y}}_{ab}\) are diagonal, involves inverting their non-zero diagonal entries and leaving the zero entries in place.

    Let the singular values of \(\matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}}\) be \(\lambda_i\) for \(i \in [1, \min\{o_A, o_B\}] \cap \Z\) such that \(\lambda_{i} \geq \lambda_{i+1}\),
    \begin{equation}
      \rho(A,B|X=x,Y=y) = \lambda_2\left( \matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}} \right).
    \end{equation}

    Working with the normalised form of the maximum correlation function, and so considering only normalised functions, we have
    \begin{align}
      \E[f(A)g(B)|xy] &= \sum_{a,b} p(a,b|x,y) f(a)g(b) \\
                      &= \sum_{a,b} \sqrt{p(a|x)} f(a) \frac{p(a,b|x,y)}{\sqrt{p(a|x)p(b|y)}} \sqrt{p(b|y)} g(b) \\
                      &= \rvec{f} \matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}} \cvec{g},
    \end{align}
    where we have defined
    \begin{equation}
      \cvec{f} = {[\sqrt{p(a|x)} f(a)]}^T_a \qquad \cvec{g} = {[\sqrt{p(b|y)} g(b)]}^T_b.
    \end{equation}
    The technicalities arising from cases where \(p(a|x)\) or \(p(b|y)\) are zero, and therefore \(p(a,b|x,y) = 0\), are handled by the Moore-Penrose inverse, which maps those entries of \(\matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}}\) to zero.

    We also represent \(\matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}}\) in its compact singular value decomposition as
    \begin{equation}
      \matrp{\tilde{P}}{_{AB|xy}} = \sum_i \lambda_i \cvec{u}_i \rvec{v}_i,
    \end{equation}
    where \(\{\cvec{u}_i\}\) and \(\{\cvec{v}_i\}\) are sets of orthonormal vectors in \(\R^{o_A}\) and \(\R^{o_B}\) respectively.

    It is known that~\cite[Thm 1]{ComputingMaxCorr} \(\lambda_i \in [0, 1]\), and
    \begin{equation}
      \lambda_1 = 1 \qquad \cvec{u}_1 = {[\sqrt{p(a|x)}]}_a^T \qquad \cvec{v}_1 = {[\sqrt{p(b|y)}]}_b^T.
    \end{equation}
    This gives us that
    \begin{align}
      \rvec{f} \cvec{u}_1 &= \sum_a p(a|x) f(a) = \E[f(A)|x] = 0 \\
      \norm{\cvec{f}}_2 &= \sum_a p(a|x) {f(a)}^2 = \E[{f(A)}^2|x] = 1 \\
      \rvec{v}_1 \cvec{g} &= \sum_b p(b|y) g(b) = \E[g(B)|y] = 0 \\
      \norm{\cvec{g}}_2 &= \sum_b p(b|y) {g(b)}^2 = \E[{g(B)}^2|y] = 1.
    \end{align}

    The singular value decomposition can be characterised variationally by
    \begin{Array}{rcl}
      \lambda_1(\matr{M}) = & \max_{\cvec{f},\cvec{g}} & \rvec{f} \matr{M} \cvec{g} \\
                            & \text{s.t.} & \norm{\cvec{f}}_2 = \norm{\cvec{g}}_2 = 1, \\
    \end{Array}
    for an arbitrary matrix \(\matr{M}\) by using Lagrange multipliers to constrain \(\cvec{f}\) and \(\cvec{g}\). This maximum is achieved by \(\cvec{f} = \cvec{u}_1\), \(\cvec{g} = \cvec{v}_1\). With the additional constraint of \(\rvec{f} \cvec{u}_1 = \rvec{v}_1 \cvec{g} = 0\), the maximum is \(\lambda_2(\matr{M})\), achieved by \(\cvec{f} = \cvec{u}_2\), \(\cvec{g} = \cvec{v}_2\). We can apply this property directly to find the maximal correlation, and the functions which achieve it, from the singular value and corresponding singular vectors for \(i = 2\).

    Observe that, for \(K_A\) and \(K_B\), two perfectly correlated and uniformly distributed secret keys, we have \(\rho(K_A, K_B) = 1\), with the maximum achieved by mapping half of the keys to \(1\) and half to \(-1\) for both \(f\) and \(g\). However, if the two keys are independent, then \(\rho(K_A,K_B) = \E[f(K_A)g(K_B)] = \E[f(K_A)]\E[g(K_B)] = 0\). Likewise, if the two keys are deterministic (not secret), then \(f(K_A) = g(K_B) = 0\) and so \(\rho(K_A, K_B) = 0\). However, this poses an issue for longer keys. Even if there are only two possible values for the key, as long as they are uniformly distributed, \(\rho(K_A, K_B) = 1\), even though Alice and Bob effectively share only one bit of secrecy! Therefore, we need to find a bound that looks something like
    \begin{equation}
      \max_{E|AB} \frac{H(A|E) - H(A|B)}{H(A)} \leq f(\rho(A,B)).
    \end{equation}

    Some other related measures are the hypercontractivity (HC) ribbon:
    \begin{equation}
      \HC(A,B) = \{(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \in {[0,1]}^2 \st \forall U, \lambda_A I(U;A) + \lambda_B I(U;B) \leq I(U;AB)\},
    \end{equation}
    or equivalently,
    \begin{equation}
      \HC(A,B) = \{(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \in {[0,1]}^2 \st \forall f,g; \E[f(A)g(B)] \leq {\E[\abs{f(A)}^{1/\lambda_A}]}^{\lambda_A} {\E[\abs{g(B)}^{1/\lambda_B}]}^{\lambda_B} \},
    \end{equation}
    or, with \(\Upsilon_{AB}(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) = \lambda_A H(A) + \lambda_B H(B) - H(AB)\) and \(\tilde{\Upsilon}_{AB}\) its lower convex envelope (pointwise largest convex function that fulfills \(\tilde{\Upsilon}_{AB}(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \leq \Upsilon_{AB}(\lambda_A, \lambda_B)\) for all \(\lambda_A, \lambda_B\)):
    \begin{equation}
      \HC(A,B) = \{(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \in {[0,1]}^2 \st \Upsilon_{AB}(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) = \tilde{\Upsilon}_{AB}(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \};
    \end{equation}
    and the maximal correlation (MC) ribbon:
    \begin{equation}
      \MC(A,B) = \{(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \in {[0,1]}^2 \st \forall f; \Var[f(A,B)] \geq \lambda_A \Var_A[\E_{B|A}[f(A,B)]] + \lambda_B \Var_B[\E_{A|B}[f(A,B)]] \},
    \end{equation}
    which can be normalised by restricting to \(\E[f(A,B)] = 0\), giving
    \begin{equation}
      \MC(A,B) = \{(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \in {[0,1]}^2 \st \forall f; \E[{f(A,B)}^2] \geq \lambda_A \E_A[{(\E_{B|A}[f(A,B)])}^2] + \lambda_B \E_B[{(\E_{A|B}[f(A,B)])}^2] \}.
    \end{equation}
    These ribbons can be defined as the union of the ribbons for the conditional distributions for the boxes, and are notable because they expand under wirings and occupy the whole of \({[0,1]}^2\) for independent variables.

    The relations between them are
    \begin{gather}
      {\rho(A,B)}^2 = \inf_{\substack{(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \in \MC(A,B) \\ \lambda_B \neq 0}} \frac{1 - \lambda_A}{\lambda_B} \\
      \HC(A,B) \subseteq \MC(A,B) \\
      s^*(A,B) \coloneqq \inf_{\substack{(\lambda_A, \lambda_B) \in \HC(A,B) \\ \lambda_B \neq 0}} \frac{1 - \lambda_A}{\lambda_B} \geq {\rho(A,B)}^2
    \end{gather}

    We have 24 positivity facets of the local polytope, and 24 liftings of CHSH\@.

    \section{State of the Art Lower Bounds}

    The methods involved in casting the relative entropy into an easily optimised form are highly involved, using the operator algebra approach to quantum mechanics. For our purposes, we will simplify and specialise the involved concepts to this particular application.

    \emph{Spectral measures}, or \emph{projector-valued measures} (PVMs), map a \emph{\(\sigma\)-algebra} of measurement outcomes to the orthogonal projectors associated with those outcomes. The \(\sigma\)-algebra contains subsets of the possible measurement outcomes, and is closed under set complements and unions of countable sequences. For a Hermitian operator \(H\) with eigenvalues \(\{\lambda_i\}\) and projectors into their eigenspaces \(\{\Pi_i\}\), the spectral measure \(E_H(x)\) of \(H\) is then
    \[ E_H(x) = \begin{cases}
      \Pi_i & x = \lambda_i \\
      0 & x \not\in \{\lambda_i\} \\
    \end{cases} \]
    A \emph{joint spectral measure} of two commuting Hermitian operators \(H^{(1)}\) and \(H^{(2)}\) is
    \[ E_{H^{(1)},H^{(2)}}(x,y) = \begin{cases}
      \Pi_i^{(1)}\Pi_j^{(2)} & x = \lambda^{(1)}_i, y = \lambda^{(2)}_j\\
      0 & x \not\in \{\lambda^{(1)}_i\} \vee y \not\in \{\lambda^{(2)}_j\}, \\
    \end{cases} \]
    with analogous extensions to more than two commuting operators.
